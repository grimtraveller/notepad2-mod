[flos-freeware] New Release: Notepad2 Version 4.2.25
From: Florian Balmer <florian.balmer@xxxxxxxxx>
To: flos-freeware@xxxxxxxxxxxxx
Date: Fri, 6 May 2011 12:25:06 +0200


Dear subscribers of this newsletter,

The final version of Notepad2 4.2.25 is out now.

There's no more changes compared to Notepad2 4.2.25-rc9. The new
features are listed in the readme file, and commented on the mailing
list (the archive is accessible through the Notepad2 website).

Notepad2 is now available as a 64-bit build (AMD64 or x86-64 processor
architecture, x64 for short). The 32-bit (x86) build is recommended
for most cases, and the Notepad2 FAQ (accessible through the Notepad2
website) explains in which cases it is preferable to use the x64
build.

The new Notepad2 Setup Tool can be used to replace Windows Notepad
with Notepad2, using a clean, unintrusive registry-based method. The
Windows Notepad can be restored by uninstalling Notepad2 from the
Control Panel. Usage notes to the setup tool can be found in the
Notepad2 FAQ, explaining command line switches, handling of settings
on updating and uninstalling, and how to pin Notepad2 to the taskbar.

The source code of the setup tool will be available on the Notepad2
website, soon.

  http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html

There's also new version of metapath, the Explorer-like add-on for
Notepad2.

[flos-freeware] Notepad2 4.2.25-rc9
From: Florian Balmer <florian.balmer@xxxxxxxxx>
To: flos-freeware@xxxxxxxxxxxxx
Date: Thu, 5 May 2011 10:42:53 +0200


Dear subscribers of this newsletter,

Notepad2 4.2.25-rc9 has a new command to merge blank lines (Alt+Y), is
able to jump to and restore scrolling positions more unerringly if
word wrap is enabled (i.e. when reloading files, or jumping to
positions with the /g command line switch), and fixes some cases with
missing filename extensions in the title bar.

  http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html

The final release of 4.2.25 will be readily available!

Dear subscribers of this newsletter,

Notepad2 4.2.25-rc8 fixes a problem with the mouse cursor disappearing
in some cases when hovering the editor margin (thanks to Pi for
reporting this issue).

If there's no more problem reports, the final version of Notepad2
4.2.25 will be ready, soon.

[flos-freeware] Notepad2 4.2.25-rc7
From: Florian Balmer <florian.balmer@xxxxxxxxx>
To: flos-freeware@xxxxxxxxxxxxx
Date: Sat, 2 Apr 2011 11:14:51 +0200


Dear subscribers of this newsletter,

Notepad2 4.2.25-rc7 has been unleashed.

The sort lines functionality has been expanded, there's support for
column sorting (based on rectangular selections), and options to
remove duplicate and unique lines, useful to compose positive and
negative intersections from a set of selected lines.

There's new functions to convert a single selected character to its
hex code representation, and vice versa (Ctrl+Alt+X, Ctrl+Alt+C). They
are Unicode-aware, and understand both \x## and \u#### hex codes. The
Transform backslashes function in the find and replace dialogs now
also accepts \u#### codes.

Keyword highlighting for the various HTML-embedded languages has been
fixed, thereby keywords have been updated to the latest working drafts
of HTML5 and CSS3.

[flos-freeware] Notepad2 4.2.25-rc6
From: Florian Balmer <florian.balmer@xxxxxxxxx>
To: flos-freeware@xxxxxxxxxxxxx
Date: Mon, 14 Mar 2011 20:14:03 +0100


Dear subscribers of this newsletter,

There's some more fine-tuning required before the final release of
Notepad2 4.2.25, so another "Release Candidate" (rc6) has been
published.

The modify lines dialog now provides some clickable links to
facilitate insertion of the cryptic number macros. A bug with padding
zeros has also been fixed (thanks to KamLeong Lai for reporting).

The "Select To Next" (F2) and "Select To Previous" (Shift+F2) commands
have been re-enabled, and can now be found in the "Edit", "Special"
submenu. The "Select Up" and "Select Down" buttons have been removed
from the find dialog. The new ways to use these commands are selecting
the find text (Alt+F3) and hitting (Shift+)F2; pressing (Shift+)F2
inside the find and replace dialogs; clicking the "Find Next" and
"Find Previous" buttons while holding down the Shift key in the find
and replace dialogs.

The PHP keywords are now highlighted, again. Some more default
filename extensions have been added to the PowerShell scheme.

The leading "Unicode" portion has been removed from the descriptions
of the UTF-8 and UTF-7 encodings, so they should be easier to find
(visually and by typing) in the encoding selection lists.

[flos-freeware] Notepad2 4.2.25-rc5
From: Florian Balmer <florian.balmer@xxxxxxxxx>
To: flos-freeware@xxxxxxxxxxxxx
Date: Sun, 27 Feb 2011 11:43:43 +0100


Dear subscribers of this newsletter,

Notepad2 4.2.25-rc5 has been released.

There's a new command line switch to determine if a new window should
always stay on top (/o), or not (/o-). This setting is not saved on
exit, unless explicitly changed through the settings menu.

The hotkey Ctrl+Shift+P moves the Notepad2 window to a default
position on the current screen. The hotkey to copy the current window
position as a Notepad2.exe command line option to clipboard has been
remapped to Ctrl+Shift+K.

Download from the Notepad2 website:

  http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html

There's also an update to metapath, fixing a problem with passing
command line switches to the external quick viewer program. The
command to move the window to a default position has also been added
to metapath.

[flos-freeware] Notepad2 4.2.25-rc3
From: Florian Balmer <florian.balmer@xxxxxxxxx>
To: flos-freeware@xxxxxxxxxxxxx
Date: Sun, 13 Feb 2011 21:42:27 +0100


Dear subscribers of this newsletter,

Notepad2 4.2.25-rc3 has been published.

The changes include a simplification of the caret (cursor) settings by
merging the two caret items (size and color) into one. Along with
this, a new option has been added to stop the caret from blinking, see
Notepad2 FAQ [1]. Moreover, a bug with the extra line spacing setting
not saved correctly in some cases has been fixed. Thanks to Nissim
Salinas for initiating these improvements.

Download from the Notepad2 website:

  http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html

Many people keep asking me whether they should use the x86 or the x64
build of Notepad2. I've added some information to help with this
decision to the Notepad2 FAQ [1] (last topic).

[1] http://www.flos-freeware.ch/doc/notepad2-FAQs.html

This is presumably the last "Release Candidate" before the final
release of Notepad2 version 4.2.25.

All the best

[flos-freeware] Notepad2 4.2.25-rc2
From: Florian Balmer <florian.balmer@xxxxxxxxx>
To: flos-freeware@xxxxxxxxxxxxx
Date: Thu, 3 Feb 2011 20:14:10 +0100


Dear subscribers of this newsletter,

Notepad2 4.2.25-rc2 is out.

Due to some complaints about the missing ability to suppress the "Text
not found" notification message, I have decided to restore the
previous behaviour. However, the ini-file can be tweaked to prevent
individual messages from being suppressed, as explained in the
Notepad2 FAQ, topic "How to reset the Notepad2 notification
messages?".

[flos-freeware] Notepad2 4.2.25-rc1
From: Florian Balmer <florian.balmer@xxxxxxxxx>
To: flos-freeware@xxxxxxxxxxxxx
Date: Tue, 1 Feb 2011 22:16:27 +0100


Dear subscribers of this newsletter,

Notepad2 4.2.25-rc1 is now available.

There's a new command to align lines (Alt+J), either left, right,
centered or block justified, taking into account indenting whitespace.
Block justification has a paragraph mode, causing lines followed by a
blank line and a text length of less than 80% of the block width to be
left aligned, forming a visual closure to the paragraph.

The modify lines (Alt+M) dialog supports several variables to insert
continuous numbers, either zero-based, one-based, or based on the
document line numbers, with or without padding zeros. The sort lines
dialog (Alt+O) has a new option to shuffle lines.

Files can now be recoded in UTF-16 Little Endian and UTF-16 Big Endian
formats, for cases where Unicode detection is inappropriate. The new
hotkey Ctrl+Shift+F recodes the current file in the default encoding
set by the user.

Analogous to "Tab key reformats indentation", there's a "Backspace
reformats indentation" option (Ctrl+T) to control the behaviour of the
backspace key inside indenting whitespace (delete or unindent).

The update to Scintilla 2.24 introduces some improvements to the
search functionality: Notepad2 now finally supports case insensitive
searching for non-ASCII characters! The built-in regular expression
engine has a new ? operator, acting as a 0-or-1-times quantifier, or a
non-greedy modifier to the * and + quantifiers. For example, <.+>
matches all HTML tags on a line, whereas <.+?> matches only one tag.
The syntax for regular expression tagged regions has been simplified
from \(...\) to (...), called POSIX compatible mode in Scintilla. As a
consequence, bare ( and ) need to be matched using \( and \) in
regular expression mode.

Some find and replace hotkeys (F3, Shift+F3, Alt+F3 and F4) also work
inside the find and replace dialog boxes. And, it's no longer possible
to suppress the text not found message.

Additional Emacs file variables allow control over word wrap
(truncate-lines), tab key behaviour (c-tab-always-indent), and file
variable parsing itself (enable-local-variables). The statement
"enable-local-variables=false" within the 512 head or tail bytes of a
file will shut down file variable parsing.

If the default font has been set to "Consolas", there's a fallback to
"Lucida Console" on systems where "Consolas" is not installed. This
improves settings portability between Windows 7 and earlier versions
of Windows.

The new /l and /l- command line switches can be used to enable or
disable auto-reloading of files modified by external programs. A
timeout before auto-reloading files prevents potential read/write
locks (can be configured in the Notepad2 ini-file).

Handling of pathnames on the command line is now more flexible and
also accepts forward slashes as pathname separators. Everything
following the + or - switches is now considered a pathname, thus
allowing pathnames with / and - as their first character:

  notepad2.exe - /dir/file

Furthermore, there's various smaller changes to syntax schemes and
keywords, the Notepad .LOG feature has been fixed, Notepad2 no longer
locks any directories except the one where Notepad2.exe resides, and
filename extensions are always displayed, regardless of the Windows
Explorer settings. Ctrl+Shift+P copies the current window position as
a Notepad2.exe command line option to clipboard. The unnecessary
notification messages after importing and exporting style settings
have been removed, but an adequate error message pops up if there's a
failure when exporting styles.

The toolbar buttons should look better on Windows 2000, and the
appearance of the disabled toolbar buttons has been modernized on
Windows XP and newer versions of Windows (can be manually reset
through an ini-file option).

The official release of Notepad2.exe is now available as a 64-bit
build (AMD64 or x86-64 processor architecture, x64 for short). The
64-bit target machine of the executable file is indicated in the
Notepad2.exe file properties (right-click in Windows Explorer, and
choose Properties).

Last but not least, Notepad2 has a tiny setup tool to replace Windows
Notepad with Notepad2 [1], based on the setup program created by Kai
Liu [2]. Complete uninstallation is possible through Windows Control
Panel.

  [1] http://www.flos-freeware.ch/doc/notepad2-Replacement.html
  [2] http://code.kliu.org/misc/notepad2/

The 64-bit portability warnings have been eliminated from the source
code, and the build scripts have been simplified with a makefile.
Notepad2 4.2.25-rc1 is based on Scintilla 2.24. The source code of the
setup tool will be published with the final release of Notepad2
4.2.25.

Download from the Notepad2 website:

  http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html

There's also new 64-bit build of metapath, the Explorer-like add-on
for Notepad2.

[flos-freeware] Updates to modified versions of Notepad2
From: Florian Balmer <florian.balmer@xxxxxxxxx>
To: flos-freeware@xxxxxxxxxxxxx
Date: Sun, 21 Nov 2010 11:22:39 +0100


Dear subscribers of this newsletter,

Today I'm announcing updates to some modified versions of Notepad2:
the code folding patches initiated by Kai Liu have been adapted to the
most recent version of Notepad2. Download links can be found on the
Notepad2 website:

  http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html

There's some work in progress on my official version of Notepad2,
focusing on editing features, bug fixes and detail improvements.
Still, I'm not sure whether or not to merge the code folding patches
into my official source code tree. For the moment, people who'd like
to use this feature could try the modified versions mentioned above.

Best wishes,

[flos-freeware] Notepad2 Source Code Update
From: Florian Balmer <florian.balmer@xxxxxxxxx>
To: flos-freeware@xxxxxxxxxxxxx
Date: Fri, 5 Mar 2010 10:25:17 +0100


Dear subscribers of this newsletter,

Thanks to feedback by several people, I have improved my WDK build
scripts shipped with the Notepad2 source code. The scripts now
completely rely on the WDK tools, there's no more dependencies on
Visual C++ tools and header files. It's now possible to rebuild
Notepad2 using only the WDK tools, refer to the Readme.txt file
included in the Notepad2 source zip for more information.

This update does not affect Notepad2 executable files.

[flos-freeware] New Release: Notepad2 Version 4.1.24
From: Florian Balmer <florian.balmer@xxxxxxxxx>
To: flos-freeware@xxxxxxxxxxxxx
Date: Tue, 2 Mar 2010 11:31:39 +0100


Dear subscribers of this newsletter,

Notepad2 version 4.1.24 has been released.

Compared to the preliminary "Release Candidate" versions, there's only
a few minor changes.

There's a new option (accessible through the "Tab Settings" dialog) to
specify whether the tab key should reformat indenting whitespace
(according to the current indentation settings), or just insert a tab
character (or the corresponding amount of spaces, depending on the
selected preferences), if the cursor is placed inside indenting
whitespace. It's always possible to insert a tab character by pressing
Ctrl+Tab.

Pathnames are stored relative to My Documents to enhance USB stick
portability between Windows XP and newer versions of Windows. This
affects MRU lists as well as the "Favorites" and "Open with..."
directories, and can be disabled in the ini-file.

The cursor visibility patch originally submitted by Kai Liu has been
rewritten to be more general, and ensure a minimum contrast between
the cursor color and the background color.

  http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html

There's also an update for metapath, my file browser plugin. The
operating system-independent handling of the My Documents location has
also been enabled for metapath, and a bug to keep visited directories
locked has been fixed.

[flos-freeware] Release Candidate 3: Notepad2 Version 4.1.24
From: Florian Balmer <florian.balmer@xxxxxxxxx>
To: flos-freeware@xxxxxxxxxxxxx
Date: Sun, 7 Feb 2010 11:08:17 +0100


Dear subscribers of this newsletter,

The next "Release Candidate" of Notepad2 is available. Due to some
important new features, the minor revision number has been increased
in the meantime, that's why Notepad2 4.0.24-rc2 is followed by
Notepad2 4.1.24-rc3.

The /z command line switch (to support registry-based Notepad
replacement) now has the same effect as the - command line switch
(accept only a single non-quoted filename argument), to ensure best
compatibility when using Notepad2 as a Windows Notepad replacement.

Notepad2 now displays an indicator in the title bar if running with
elevated (administrator) privileges on Windows Vista and above.
Elevated instances will be isolated from instances running with
standard privileges regarding window reuse and single file instance
features. A new /u command line switch simplifies launching
Notepad2.exe with administrator rights (brings up the UAC prompt).

Error messages for file operation failures are now more informative,
they also display the operating system error message text.

Some changes to the syntax highlighting schemes include new HTML and
XML element text styles, improved utilization of default styles for
schemes embedded within HTML, and the possibility to change the size
of the visible white space dots. Moreover, word wrap settings have
been adapted to allow more control over visual indicator display.

[flos-freeware] Release Candidate 2: Notepad2 Version 4.0.24
From: Florian Balmer <florian.balmer@xxxxxxxxx>
To: flos-freeware@xxxxxxxxxxxxx
Date: Tue, 5 Jan 2010 11:52:08 +0100


Dear subscribers of this newsletter,

Another "Release Candidate" (rc2) of Notepad2 4.0.24 is available.

There's some new ini-file options to control system MRU, taskbar and
jump list behaviour. These settings can be useful to enable recent
file access through the Windows 7 jump lists if Notepad2 is used as a
Windows Notepad replacement. The documentation has been updated to
explain the new settings.

[flos-freeware] Release Candidate: Notepad2 Version 4.0.24
From: Florian Balmer <florian.balmer@xxxxxxxxx>
To: flos-freeware@xxxxxxxxxxxxx
Date: Wed, 16 Dec 2009 16:58:04 +0100


Dear subscribers of this newsletter,

Notepad2 version 4.0.24 is now available as a "Release Candidate". I'm
planning to distribute the final version as soon as the next full
version of the Scintilla source code editing component will be
available. That's why the source code documentation says Notepad2
4.0.24 depends on Scintilla 2.02, but it's in fact the current CVS
snapshot (2.01-cvs $Date: 2009/12/16 $).

The most notable new feature is support for the /z command line switch
introduced by Kai Liu, to support registry-based Notepad replacement.

  http://www.flos-freeware.ch/doc/notepad2-Replacement.html

Another change is that font smoothing (anti-aliasing) can be
controlled globally for the Notepad2 window, independently of the
system default setting. This is useful for scenarios where
anti-aliasing is generally preferred and a certain font looks better
without, or where system restrictions prevent changing the
anti-aliasing settings.

  http://www.flos-freeware.ch/doc/notepad2-FAQs.html#q6

As of version 2.x, the Scintilla editing component makes use of the
STL. I haven't been able to rebuild the source codes using my custom
Visual C++ 6.0/7.0 build farm, any more, that's why I switched to the
WDK 7.0 build environment. Like this it's still possible to use the
system CRT and create a tiny and fast executable file with cutting
edge technology (that is, the up-to-date msvcrt.dll and msvcp60.dll
runtime libraries available on any Windows system).

My build scripts are included in the Notepad2 source code package. For
the future, I may create a new section on my website with
documentation and examples how to build Notepad2 with other
development tools.

[flos-freeware] New Release: Notepad2 Version 4.0.23
From: Florian Balmer <florian.balmer@xxxxxxxxx>
To: flos-freeware@xxxxxxxxxxxxx
Date: Tue, 6 Oct 2009 18:51:20 +0200


Dear subscribers of this newsletter,

Notepad2 version 4.0.23 has been released.

There is now support for PowerShell Script syntax highlighting.
Besides that, some of the syntax schemes have been simplified, and the
default settings have been revised. Also, some bugs and annoyances
have been corrected, and internal changes allow complete
internationalization of the Notepad2 executable file from resource
strings (a future project).

  http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html

I hope that Kai Liu, who is maintaining an extended version of
Notepad2 to support code folding and other enhancements, will also
update his work, soon.

[flos-freeware] New Release: Notepad2 Version 4.0.22
From: Florian Balmer <florian.balmer@xxxxxxxxx>
To: flos-freeware@xxxxxxxxxxxxx
Date: Tue, 28 Jul 2009 11:42:39 +0200


Dear subscribers of this newsletter,

The final version of Notepad2 4.0.22 has been published.

As advertised in the release notes for the 4.0-beta versions, the
major addition is enhanced support for numerous Windows, DOS, ISO, Mac
and IBM EBCDIC encodings, as well as for additional Unicode
Transformation Formats like UTF-7 and GB18030. With auto-detection of
encoding tags, including HTML/XML meta tags to specify the character
encoding, the new features are convenient to use.

Besides that, the File Change Notification settings are regrouped in a
dialog box, and provide an option to automatically reload unmodified
files. Other changes cover special variants of the tabify and untabify
commands to modify only indenting whitespace, and hotkeys to increase
or decrease selected integral or hexadecimal numbers. Find results are
scrolled away from the top and bottom borders, so that more contextual
lines are visible.

Due to consolidation of redundant styles to simplify customization
(affecting mostly comments and strings), some style settings may have
to be readapted. Also note there's now a default setting of +2 for
extra line spacing (can be removed).

  http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html

Special thanks to Kai Liu, who has again contributed useful features
and fixes. Kai is maintaining an extended version of Notepad2 to
support code folding, an installer allowing clean and completely
undoable Windows Notepad replacement, additional syntax schemes, and
other improvements.

  http://code.kliu.org/misc/notepad2/

Also thank you very much to everybody for sending me interesting
feedback, feature requests, and problem reports. Notepad2 is still
just a hobby, yet, from time to time, I'm putting all my heart and
soul into this project.

So, what's next?

The two most laborious items on my task list for Notepad2 have been
accomplished, in the past year: creating a native Win32 Unicode build,
and adding enhanced encoding support. Currently, there's no major new
features of the same scale I'd like to integrate into Notepad2.

The most frequently requested features by Notepad2 users are:

* Enhanced regular expression engine. Recent versions of the Scintilla
source code editing component allow embedding an external regex
library.

* Display text statistics (mostly word and character counting).
Currently, the statusbar displays bytes instead of characters in
non-ANSI mode.

* More extensive print header customization (display additional file
information, allow custom fonts).

At the current stage I do not promise I will work on these features,
straight away, but I will certainly keep this list in mind for future
development.

Best wishes,

[flos-freeware] Notepad2 4.0.22-beta5
From: Florian Balmer <florian.balmer@xxxxxxxxx>
To: flos-freeware@xxxxxxxxxxxxx
Date: Tue, 21 Jul 2009 13:37:58 +0200


Dear subscribers of this newsletter,

Despite my recent announcement of features being complete for 4.0.22,
I have decided to merge some more useful patches contributed by Kai
Liu into my own source code branch.

The most visible addition is a consolidation of styles that are
equivalent in practical use, but differentiated internally. This
simplifies configuration of line and block comments, single and double
quoted strings, and some other styles. Another patch ensures the
cursor stays visible on any background color.

  http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html

The final version of Notepad2 4.0.22 should be ready within a week.

[flos-freeware] Notepad2 4.0.22-beta4
From: Florian Balmer <florian.balmer@xxxxxxxxx>
To: flos-freeware@xxxxxxxxxxxxx
Date: Thu, 16 Jul 2009 17:00:07 +0200


Dear subscribers of this newsletter,

Another beta version of Notepad2 4.0.22 has been published.

When reloading files (either manually or automatically through the
file change notification feature), Notepad2 tries to be smarter at
keeping the current encoding. If new byte order marks, encoding tags
or invalid byte sequences (for the current encoding) have been added
to the file, usual encoding detection is performed, otherwise, the
encoding is preserved.

As in previous versions, files with unrecognized encoding tags are
loaded in ANSI mode (if encoding tag parsing is enabled).

Some cleanup with Chinese Simplified encodings was done: GB2312 was
correctly renamed to GBK (which includes the GB2312 subset), and
GB18030 (being the current standard) was added.

The way encoding settings are stored has been refurbished, again: for
non-standard encodings, the Windows code page id number is remembered.
It's easier to track down problems like this, and the settings are
resistant to future expansion. Compatibility to Notepad2 3.x is
assured, but 4.0-beta users may need to reconfigure default encoding
options, one last time.

My official Notepad2.exe program file will no longer be compressed
with UPX. This slightly increases disk space usage, but reduces
virtual memory consumption if running multiple instances. Users
preferring a minimal executable file size can still use UPX to achieve
this.

The features scheduled for Notepad2 4.0.22 are completed, and so far
also stable. The final version of Notepad2 4.0.22 can be expected to
be released, soon.

[flos-freeware] Notepad2 4.0.22-beta3
From: Florian Balmer <florian.balmer@xxxxxxxxx>

Date: Sat, 11 Jul 2009 17:50:10 +0200


Dear subscribers of this newsletter,

The 3rd beta version of Notepad2 4.0.22 has been released.

The effective range of the --e command line switch has been expanded
to newly created files and untitled documents.

The following command will now bring up a Notepad2 window in KOI8-R
mode:

  notepad2.exe --e koi8-r

The next example demonstrates how to silently create a new file in the
desired encoding:

  notepad2.exe --e ibm437 --q c:\dir\newfile.txt

Support for some common EBCDIC encodings has been enabled, as well.

Encoding ini-settings are mapped back to the previous settings as of
Notepad2 version 3.x to retain ini-file compatibility. Users of
Notepad2 4.0.22-beta1 and beta2 may need to set default encoding
options, once again.

A new option to set extra line spacing has been added to the default
and 2nd default schemes.

Dear subscribers of this newsletter,

The 2nd beta version of Notepad2 4.0.22 has been released.

File change notification settings have been regrouped inside a dialog
box that can be reached with a hotkey (Alt+F5). There's an option to
reset file change notification each time a new file is opened.

The word wrap settings have been revised, and new options available
through the Scintilla editing component have been enabled.

Besides that, some minor coding bugs have been fixed (discovered when
reviewing patches by Kai Liu [1], thanks!) and some minor glitches
have been corrected.

Date: Thu, 25 Jun 2009 17:57:31 +0200


Dear subscribers of this newsletter,

I have been working on a new version of Notepad2 with enhanced
encoding support, for some time. I have now decided to merge the 3.x
branch (a maintenance update was ready) with the next big development
step, so here's the first beta version of Notepad2 4.0.

Notepad2 now provides seamless support for numerous Windows, DOS, ISO
and Mac encodings. The new encoding features are summarized here:

  http://www.flos-freeware.ch/doc/notepad2-Encoding.html

Other changes include special variants of the tabify and untabify
commands only modifying indenting whitespace, and hotkeys to increase
or decrease selected integral numbers.

File change notification has been extended with an option to
automatically reload files modified by external programs. For unsaved
or deleted files, Notepad2 still keeps displaying a confirmation
prompt. If the caret is at the last position, the file tail is
scrolled into view after the refresh.

And, I've made an attempt to scroll find results away from the top or
bottom window borders, so that more contextual lines can be seen.

The rest is just small details, listed in the Notepad2 readme file.

[flos-freeware] New Release: Notepad2 Version 3.1.21
From: Florian Balmer <florian.balmer@xxxxxxxxx>
To: flos-freeware@xxxxxxxxxxxxx
Date: Sun, 21 Jun 2009 12:54:54 +0200


Dear subscribers of this newsletter,

Many things were keeping me away from the computer, in the last weeks,
and I've never really taken care of packaging and releasing the final
version of Notepad2 3.1.21.

There's no more new features as compared to the recent Release
Candidate versions. I've incorporated some patches by Kai Liu to
create non-existent ini-file directories, and some fixes to the Apache
Config Files syntax scheme.

  http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html

A new version of metapath has also been uploaded to my website, mostly
a service and bugfix release.

[flos-freeware] Release Candidate 4: Notepad2 Version 3.1.21
From: Florian Balmer <florian.balmer@xxxxxxxxx>
To: flos-freeware@xxxxxxxxxxxxx
Date: Tue, 10 Mar 2009 16:16:58 +0100


Dear subscribers of this newsletter,

The presumably last "Release Candidate" (rc4) before the final release
of Notepad2 version 3.1.21 is ready.

Recent files are now stored with pathnames relative to the Notepad2
program directory, so they can still be opened if Notepad2 is used
from portable drives with changing drive letters. This feature is
disabled for the system drive (where multiple copies of Notepad2.exe
might be around), and can be turned off completely in the ini-file.

The find wrap notification dialogs now provide an option to stop
searching, instead of restarting from the opposite end of the file.
There's also an option to suppress the replace count notification.

The new "Pad With Spaces" command (Alt+B) can be used to fill in
spaces up to the longest line. This works with normal text selection,
block selection, or without any selection.

[flos-freeware] Release Candidate 3: Notepad2 Version 3.1.21
From: Florian Balmer <florian.balmer@xxxxxxxxx>
To: flos-freeware@xxxxxxxxxxxxx
Date: Wed, 25 Feb 2009 11:43:00 +0100


Dear subscribers of this newsletter,

The next "Release Candidate" (rc3) of Notepad2 version 3.1.21 has been
published.

This update restores compatibility of the command line format with
previous versions of Notepad2. By default, Notepad2 now again accepts
only a single filename on the command line. Like this, it's not
necessary to quote filenames containing spaces:

  Notepad2.exe test sample instance
  (opens the file "test sample instance")

To open multiple files from the command line, the new + switch can be
specified:

  Notepad2.exe + test sample instance
  (opens the files "test", "sample" and "instance")

(It may also be useful to add the /p0 command line switch when opening
multiple files, to arrange windows cascaded).

To allow opening multiple files by default, the following setting in
the Notepad2 ini-file can be modified (set to "1"):

  [Settings2]
  ...
  MultiFileArg=1

With this changed default behaviour, it's possible to drop multiple
files on a Notepad2.exe icon, or use Notepad2 from Explorer's "Send
to..." menu with multiple files selected. To switch back to the
old-compatible command line mode, even if the default behaviour has
been modified in the ini-file, the new - command line option is
useful:

  Notepad2.exe - test sample instance
  (opens the file "test sample instance")

[flos-freeware] Release Candidate 2: Notepad2 Version 3.1.21
From: Florian Balmer <florian.balmer@xxxxxxxxx>
To: flos-freeware@xxxxxxxxxxxxx
Date: Mon, 23 Feb 2009 10:52:53 +0100


Dear subscribers of this newsletter,

Another "Release Candidate" (rc2) of Notepad2 version 3.1.21 has been
released. Some new features have slipped in:

Notepad2 now accepts multiple files from the command line. The primary
instance will act as a shell and simply launch new instances of
Notepad2 with the --n command line switch (always open a new window;
there may be support for other switches like --rs in the future). This
requires filenames containing spaces to be quoted. To open just a
single file without quoted spaces, as in previous versions of
Notepad2, the new --1 command line switch can be used. Examples:

  Notepad2.exe test sample instance
  (opens the files "test", "sample" and "instance")

  Notepad2.exe --1 test sample instance
  (opens the file "test sample instance")

With the new behaviour, multiple files can be dropped on Notepad2.exe
icons, or opened with Notepad2 if used from the "Send to" menu.

Another detail change also improves usage of Notepad2 from Windows
Explorer: the "Reuse Window" option now has a timeout, during which
Notepad2 windows are locked for reuse. This allows simultaneous
opening of multiple files even if the "Reuse Window" option is
enabled.

There's some enhancements to the /p command line switches: using any
combination of f,l,t,r,b,m allows to move the Notepad2 window to a
certain position on the primary monitor. A few examples:

  Notepad2.exe --pr
  (use right half of working area)

  Notepad2.exe --pltm
  (display in left top corner, with small margin)

  Notepad2.exe --pdl
  (use default Notepad2 window position, align left)

To make it easier to distinguish Notepad2 windows with untitled
documents (or maybe even with opened files), the window title can be
set to an excerpt of the currently selected text (Ctrl+9). The default
title is restored if Ctrl+9 is pressed again with an empty text
selection, or if the document is being saved. It's also possible to
set a custom window title from the command line:

  Notepad2.exe --t "My Notes"

(The original --t command line switch to select the default text
scheme has been renamed to --d).

Various minor changes: the "Search Up" option of the find and replace
dialogs has been replaced by a "Find Previous" button. There's a new
option to automatically strip trailing blanks when saving files (File,
Line Endings, Default). Files can be reloaded without file variable
parsing (Alt+F8). And, the "Save Copy" directory is remembered until
exit.

Internal changes should restore binary compatibility with Windows
2000, and assure basic source code compatibility with x64
environments.

The complete changelog is detailed in the Notepad2 readme file.

[flos-freeware] Release Candidate: Notepad2 Version 3.1.21
From: Florian Balmer <florian.balmer@xxxxxxxxx>
To: flos-freeware@xxxxxxxxxxxxx
Date: Sat, 24 Jan 2009 17:22:05 +0100


Dear subscribers of this newsletter,

Notepad2 version 3.1.21 is now available as a "Release Candidate". The
final version is planned for the next few days to weeks.

My favorite changes are the move up and down commands now working with
selected text blocks (and not just single lines), and the new hotkeys
to have the cursor jump to either side of the text selection, so it
can be easily expanded. There's also a new command to sort lines,
support for URL encoding and decoding, and a hotkey for "Replace Next"
(F4).

Besides a few memory holes being closed, and some detail improvements,
the following modifications deserve a special consideration:

By default, Notepad2 will no longer create an ini-file. If no existing
ini-file is found, the program settings have to be saved manually
(F7), the first time.

And, there's new command line switches to specify the file encoding
and line ending mode, for example:

  Notepad2.exe --utf8 --lf file.txt

The complete changelog is detailed in the Notepad2 readme file.

[flos-freeware] New Release: Notepad2 Version 2.1.19
From: "Florian Balmer" <florian.balmer@xxxxxxxxx>
To: flos-freeware@xxxxxxxxxxxxx
Date: Thu, 10 Apr 2008 14:05:59 +0200


Dear subscribers of this newsletter,

Notepad2 version 2.1.19 has just been released. There's some new
features and many detail improvements and bug fixes, however it's
still simple and light-weight.

There's new commands to comment and uncomment source code, change
letter case, and the original Notepad .LOG feature is now supported.
The long line marker can easily be moved with the keyboard. The
ini-file provides a new option to specify filters for the open and
save dialogs. New command line switches can be used to specify the
location of the ini-file (or use no ini-file at all), and to open a
new window using a system default window position. Compatibility with
Windows Vista has been improved (Notepad2 has been made aware of file
virtualization), and the toolbar buttons look somewhat smoother.

Download from the Notepad2 website:

  http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html

For the time being, I have decided I will no longer host or maintain a
list of links to translated versions of Notepad2.

Dear subscribers of this newsletter,

I have just released several minor updates for some of the tools in my
Project Archive. The most important is a new version of metapath
(3.2.09) with support for ini-file storage of the program settings, so
it works the same as Notepad2. For the other tools, there's just a few
fixes of visual glitches (list view columns) and additions (manifest
resources) for Vista.

Dear subscribers of this newsletter,

After almost three years, a new version of Notepad2 has just been
